## DEFINITIONS

As of this writing, the nomenclature for the Writers Guild (hereafter, the
Guild) tiered membership system is still being considered. We want to have
more fun with it, but have not settled on what that fun looks like. Rather
than create confusion around tier names, the tiers will be simplified as
follows:

- Tier 1 represents the lowest membership, or entry level tier, what is
currently referred to as “Pupil” in the Governance Framework;
- Tier 2 represents the middle tier, which is currently referred to as
“Scribbler; and
- Tier 3 represents the full membership tier, which is currently referred to
as “Scribe.”


## BACKGROUND

Coordinape is designed to reward active contributors. Active contributors in
the Writers Guild are at minimum Tier 2 members, with many working towards
Tier 3. Currently, Coordinape is open to all Writers Guild members. While
this simplifies signups and allows everyone in the Guild to participate, this
also has provided opportunity for low to non-contributors to game the Guild’s
compensation structure and receive a disproportionate share of Guild funds
set aside for seasonal Coordinape rounds. The results from the Season 4 Guild
Epoch have shown this to be the case. This proposal seeks to better align the
purpose of Coordinape with contributions being made in the Guild.

## SOLUTION & tl;dr

Guild Coordinape rounds will be gated to Tier 2 members and above, while
maintaining the current stipulations that role holders are unqualified to
receive, but may distribute, GIVE.

## REASONING

While it would be easy enough to place participation in a Guild Coordinape
round as an additional member perk for Tier 3, we recognize that there is
much work done around the Guild by members who do not yet qualify for Tier 3.
As Tier 2 was established to recognize those members who are working their
way toward Tier 3, and thus contributing to the Guild and any of its resident
projects or partnerships, members have come to soft consensus that Tier 2
should be welcome to participate in Guild Coordinape Epochs.

## IMPLEMENTATION

Upon ratification of this proposal, verbiage will be included in the
Governance Framework stating accessibility to Guild Coordinape Epochs will be
gated and open to those members of Tier 2 and above status. The Epoch taking
place at the end of Season 5 will be the first to implement this gating
protocol.
