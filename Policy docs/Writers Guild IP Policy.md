The purpose of this document is to clarify the intellectual property (IP)
policy for the BanklessDAO Writers Guild. 
  
### Spirit of the Policy
Given that BanklessDAO isn’t a legal entity (and therefore cannot enter into
legal agreements), the spirit of the policy is how we align ourselves as a
group. Our goal is to create a publishing house that stays true to the shared
blockchain values of decentralization, transparency, and permissionlessness.
  
To accomplish this, we need an IP policy that:
- Encourages writers to publish with us over the long term
- Maximizes the potential reach and impact of each piece of writing
- Allows flexibility for both the author and BanklessDAO
  
In general, the policy grants BanklessDAO rights similar to [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/);
the key difference is that the writer grants this license specifically to
BanklessDAO while also committing to a reciprocal attribution arrangement.
  
### The Policy
When a writer submits a piece of writing (henceforth: “the goods”) to
BanklessDAO, they are granting BanklessDAO the perpetual, irrevocable right
to distribute the goods via any DAO channels in exchange for some amount of
BANK.
- In doing so, the writer agrees that the goods may be edited, adapted, or
otherwise transformed by BanklessDAO, depending on the needs of the
publishing channel. Wherever possible, this will be done in consultation with
the writer.
- The amount of BANK depends on the distribution channel and current
remuneration policy, which can be found on the Writers Guild Notion page, or
by asking the Guild Treasurer.
- If the goods are published to more than one channel, then the author is
entitled to the BANK amount posted for each individual channel.
The goods may be published to non-remunerated channels without additional
remuneration.
- DAO channels currently include, but are not limited to: Medium, Mirror, and
all Newsletters.  
  
The goods must be attributed to the writer when published by BanklessDAO. If
the writer decides to publish the goods outside of BanklessDAO, they must
attribute BanklessDAO. 
- Author attribution means a statement of authorship and a hyperlink to their
social media profile or website of choice.
- - ex. “This article was originally posted on BanklessDAO State of the DAOs
[link] newsletter on April 3, 2022.”
- Attribution to BanklessDAO means hyperlink to the goods where they
originally appeared on the BanklessDAO channel, or BanklessDAO’s website.
- In the event the goods are used in a form where hyperlinking is unavailable,
attribution must still be included.
- Any designs created by BanklessDAO should include a caption to attribute the
art to the artist.
- BanklessDAO editors should be individually attributed as such in the
article.
