## I. SUMMARY

Good Morning News (hereafter ‚ÄúGMN‚Äù) is a crypto news organization that was created by B(3,A)Rhunter·µç·µê‚Åøüè¥#6438 (hereafter ‚ÄúPublisher‚Äù), and offers a large opportunity for writers and editors to further develop their skills in a crowdsourced operation. As the Writers Guild (hereafter ‚Äúthe Guild‚Äù) works to lay out a foundation for determining membership in the Guild, the opportunity has arisen to work closely with GMN for the purpose of providing more work and skills practice for those interested in working within the Guild. This proposal seeks to outline a framework for collaboration that will be beneficial to both the Guild and GMN.

_tl;dr: GMN and the Guild have much to offer each other, and this doc will outline how this can be leveraged for both of our benefits._

## II. GOOD MORNING NEWS

Good Morning News is a decentralized news organization. The organization leverages NFT technology to publish a daily 'newspaper' on-chain. Anyone can submit a piece of writing or news article to the publication and the community holds a daily vote to decide which story will be published. If no original writing is submitted, a writer will draft an article based upon the the news article selected by the community. Once a story is chosen or written, editors and designers then go to work getting the piece of writing prepped for publication. Only after a story has gone through all the necessary steps does it go to publication, which involves sending the final product to the blockchain and dynamically updating the GMN NFT.

The vision for the organization is to empower writers from around the world and give them an opportunity to get their name out, learn from professionals in the industry, and make a little money on the side. The mission of the organization is to ensure information is always getting published in a decentralized fashion and ensure the distribution of information always has an immutable and censorship resistant outlet.

### What Problems will this Collaboration Solve?

GMN needs talented writers and the Guild has talented writers in need of work. This collaboration could also help the Guild consider how this technology could be implemented within the Guild long term.

### What can GMN Offer the Guild?

GMN can offer the Guild an outlet for writers and editors who are in need of work; looking to sharpen their skills; and learn how to write or edit for a news organization. Additionally, GMN can offer access to the technology the protocol is built upon. This means the Guild would have access to a suite of tools that may be leveraged to bring the Guild‚Äôs products and services on-chain. Ultimately, this will elevate the Guild‚Äôs presence on Web3 systems and better position the Guild as a Web3 leader, as well as provide greater opportunities for further monetizing content., 

_tl;dr: GMN is an on-chain journalism protocol that offers writers work and exposure, and is focused on censorship-resistant distribution. GMN can offer work for Guild writers and editors, and provide the Guild with resources to bring products and services on-chain._

## III. THE WRITERS GUILD

The mission of the Guild aligns with the mission of BanklessDAO: to onboard 1 billion people into crypto. The Guild contributes to this mission by way of producing educational content, as well as providing writing and editing services to other guilds, projects, and external DAOs and protocols that seek to inform and engage all manner of individuals. Furthermore, in an effort to raise the quality of the content being produced by the Guild or contributing authors, initiatives have been introduced to assist writers and editors in improving their craft, such as the Writers Workshop, the Top Edit, and office hours for addressing specific issues in respective teams‚Äô publishing processes.

Due to the open nature of DAOs, and to best manage quality assurance and compensation, the Guild has implemented a tiered system for contribution, the highest role of which is the Scribe. The Scribe tier requires that a minimum set amount of work be done per season to attain and retain this role.

### What Problems will this Collaboration Solve?

Recently, concerns have risen regarding the quality of content being published across the Guild‚Äôs public channels. In order to address these concerns, the Editing & Publishing Arm (henceforth, ‚ÄúEPA‚Äù) of the Guild instituted the Editors Circle‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, which will manage content and copy edits, and work to develop better and more capable editors. As such, the amount of available editing work for most members has been reduced. Furthermore, there are qualifications that need to be met in order to write for Client Services. This reduces the overall work available for members to pick up in order to meet the requirements to attain and retain the role of Scribe. Two solutions have been presented to address this concern:

1. establish weighted tiers for different work completed, where bigger or more complicated effort garners more points than lighter work; or
2. reduce the amount of work required to attain and retain the role of Scribe.

While neither of these options are ideal, they do offer a way to address the concern surrounding how someone may attain and retain the role of Scribe. A collaboration with GMN may offset this concern, providing writers and editors in the Guild with more opportunities to gain the points necessary to attain and retain this role. Should this prove to be the case, then work would not need to be weighted, and the amount of work required would not need to be reduced.

### What can the Guild Offer GMN?

The Guild is offering the staff of GMN‚Äîthose who are not already members of the Guild‚Äîaccess to the writing and editing workshops, as well as access to office hours where writing and editing conversations tend to occur. GMN staff can bring in GMN-specific pieces they are working on for feedback and critical review, providing opportunities to increase the capabilities of each writer and editor. This will result in the increase of quality of GMN overall. Furthermore, in providing writers and editors to GMN, the Guild‚Äôs own talent will increase in quality, thus raising the quality of the Guild‚Äôs publishable content.

_tl;dr: the Guild serves up educational content for various bodies in alignment with the general bDAO mission. As the Guild scales, membership tiers have been introduced. Work necessary to attain the highest tier is currently not easy to come by. A partnership with GMN could solve this problem, as well as raise the quality of the work being produced by both the Guild and GMN._

## IV. TERMS & CONDITIONS

The collaboration between the Guild and GMN will be effectuated as follows:

- Guild members will be provided a GMN subscription. GMN will bulk mint a number of subscriptions each season, and the Guild will cover the related costs of minting and delivery for each subscription that is provided to a Guild member of Scribe status. Reimbursement to GMN will be sent in BANK according to the normal Guild compensation distribution schedule.
- Guild members may submit articles to GMN for vote, or edit articles chosen for publication.
    - Either Publisher or the Editor-in-Chief may select the Guild editor for a given night, giving priority to those with the lowest amount of overall contribution points to GMN.
    - Scribblers who submit pieces that are published with GMN will qualify for a subscription to GMN.
- Guild members who contribute to GMN will be paid in GMN‚Äôs native token, PAPER, and earn Guild contribution points toward attainment and retention of the role of Scribe as defined by the Guild‚Äôs Governance Framework:
    - 250 PAPER and 1 contribution point per article submitted. This includes the opportunity for pieces declined by the Guild to be picked up and published by GMN.
    - 150 PAPER and 1 contribution point per editing assignment
    - Any article chosen for publication would entitle the author to an additional 100 PAPER
- Publisher will maintain a list of Guild members to contribute to GMN, tracking their contributions, and will submit monthly totals to the Guild Secretary. Publisher will be remunerated at a rate of 50 BANK per contribution point for coordinating this effort, delivered according to the Guild‚Äôs compensation distribution schedule.
- The Record of Contribution will be kept on the Guild‚Äôs notion page for ease of access by all interested Guild members. 
- The Guild will work with GMN to determine how its various publications can best use the GMN protocol to move content on-chain.
- Either the Guild or GMN can end this Collaboration at any time by majority vote via a sesh poll at the end of each Guild season. 

## V. CONCLUSION
From its genesis, GMN was always meant to be a proof-of-concept for the Guild; to demonstrate to the Guild what was possible with NFT technology and a group of talented writers and editors. This agreement will only be the beginning of what may prove to be a flourishing, mutually beneficial collaboration between the Guild and GMN. This collaboration will help develop Guild members‚Äô writing and editing skills; improve and scale the technology developed by GMN; and help bring Guild content on-chain, thus increasing the revenue potential for the Guild.
